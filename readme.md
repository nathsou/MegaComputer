 # Megacomputer

 According to wikipedia:

A **microcomputer** is a small, relatively inexpensive [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) with a [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor) as its [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) (CPU).

Well.. Megacomputer is quite the opposite!
It's
huge, quite expensive and uses only discrete components.
